A full-stack chat app is a versatile communication platform that combines both front-end and back-end development to provide users with real-time messaging capabilities. It typically involves technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the user interface while using server-side languages like Node.js and Python for the back-end functionality. These apps offer seamless interactions, making them ideal for connecting people in various contexts, from social networking to business collaboration.
